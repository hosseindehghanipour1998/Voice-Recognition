# Voice-Recognition
Real Time , Simple , Without word recognition , Voice recognition project
 -  A joint work with Ali Mahdiyar.
 - This project takes a sample of each person’s voice and then it’s ready to  accept an input as a voice and recognize the owner and checks whether  the voice owner is in the database or not.


## Library
We used PortAudio library in order top get voice samples from the user and then used Discrete Furier Transform in order to process the samples. All the settings of the program (such as number of the channels, number of samples per second, etc) are commented and described in the source code.

If you want to make your own voice recognition project, you should modify the `main.c` module. The code is runnable on Windows and Ubuntu 16.04.
